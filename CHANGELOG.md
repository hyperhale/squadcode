# Changelog

All notable changes to Squad Code are documented here. Entries before 2.0 were written when the app was called Runo.

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- Peek reads every message in a thread first, even with the Ask or Do chip picked, and decides who takes it or answers itself. Before, a pinned Do (from the chip, Jobs' New job or the palette) sent the message straight to Builder as a job, skipping Peek. The chip is now a hint Peek reads; if Peek's engine can't be reached, the message still goes the way the chip says. Only an @, a reply to a bot, Give a job, a slash command or a set-up race or plan skips Peek.
- A short answer like "1" to a bot's question reaches Peek with the question. Peek used to see only the first 300 characters of each message, so a long bot message lost the question and choices at its end. Now each message keeps its start and its end, the newest gets up to 2,000 characters, and Peek is told a short reply answers the last question and carries on with the bot that asked it.

## [2.0.0-alpha.13] - 2026-11-14

### Changed

- The rail starts with Home, above the Inbox. The Crew's icon is a bot, and the night-shift moon is now a light and dark switch: each click steps through light, dark and your system's setting, and its icon shows which is on. The usage bar left the rail, since the status bar already shows usage.
- The Usage today popover from the status bar matches the Graphite and lime look: spend, tokens and jobs on one row, each engine with a square in its state and a DEFAULT tag, and flat plan bars that turn amber at 80% and red at 100% (the status bar's plan meter uses the same colours). When an engine's plan shows use but the crew ran nothing on it today, it says the plan counts all your Claude Code use, not only the crew's.
- A job's Browser tab no longer shows Chrome's "This site can't be reached" page after a bot stops the app it tested. It says nothing is running at that address, with Start the app and Try again, and reloads once the app answers. The LIVE badge shows only while a bot is on the job; a finished job says "Builder tested the page".
- The composer's "To Peek" chip keeps one width, so changing the bot or mode no longer shifts the toolbar, and the Ask, Do, Plan and Race switch glides to the one you pick. Switches slide, drop-downs and menus ease in, job tabs grow their underline and fade in their page, and hover tints fade instead of snapping. All of it shows straight away when Animations is off or Reduce motion is on.
- Settings > Appearance > Background image lines up: the pictures sit at the same inset as the rows below and fill each row, the Fit, Blur, Dim and Show through controls share one width, and switched-off slider tracks are visible in the dark theme.
- The app icon is flat and a little lighter: no gradient, sheen or rim, a lighter graphite tile and a slightly brighter lime.
- Reply on a bot's message replies to that message. It's quoted above the box with who said it (× or Esc drops it), what you send goes to that bot without typing an @, and the bot gets the quoted message with your words, so it knows which answer you mean. The sent message shows the quote above your words, with the whole message on hover. Edit and send again brings the quote back.
- The Run it later menu opens right above the send button's chevron, lined up with its right edge, with a small arrow pointing down at it. Late at night its first row says it starts now, and "Tomorrow morning" reads "This morning" until 5 AM.

## [2.0.0-alpha.12] - 2026-11-12

### Added

- A project switcher at the head of the sidebar shows the project's emblem, name, folder, branch and state, and drops every project with what waits or runs there; ⌥⌘1–9 (Ctrl+Alt+1–9 off a Mac) jumps to one. Each project gets its own shape and colour, so no two look alike, and Change emblem… on its right-click menu picks from 28 shapes and 8 colours.
- The terminal drawer holds several shells as tabs. + (or Cmd+T, Ctrl+Shift+T off a Mac) opens another shell in the same project or job, each tab is named by what its shell says it's doing, and its × (or Cmd+W) ends that shell. Side by side (Cmd+D) shows up to three of them next to each other, the one taking your keys marked in the accent; Fill the page (Cmd+Shift+Enter) lets the terminal take the page's place and fit itself to the height, and the same button puts it back. The job workspace's Terminal tab has the tabs and Side by side too.

### Changed

- The rail holds places only, as icons named on hover: Inbox, Overview, Jobs and Crew, with the night shift, today's usage as a thin bar (amber at 75%, red at 90%; click it for the engines), Machines and Settings at its foot. The project tiles left the rail for the switcher.
- With the right side closed, a thread's messages fill the width instead of keeping to a narrow column.
- A new app icon: Peek peeking over a terminal, in graphite and lime.
- Peek's plan cards match the Graphite and lime look: a PLAN mark with the goal, its steps and how it stands (READY TO START, WORKING · 2/3 DONE), numbered steps with each bot in a lane on the right, a bar with a segment per step once it runs, and Discard, Edit plan and Start on a hairline foot. A job being shipped counts as done in the card's tally.
- The README covers the switcher, Run app, the terminal drawer, Run it later and the new themes, with fresh screenshots.
- The Run it later menu lines up: each time has an icon, its name over why you'd pick it, and when it starts in a column on the right, the clock over the day ("11:00 PM", "today"), so both lines of every row share an edge.
- A running app no longer sits pinned over the composer. Run app turns into a small pill under the project's name with its command, port, an Open button and a chevron; its card (output, Restart, Stop) opens beside the sidebar the first time and tucks back into the pill when you go to another page or click outside it. Click the pill, or its line under Running now, to bring the card back. A crashed app shows red in the pill.
- Run app says what it will run before you press it, and opens Setup when Squad can't tell, instead of doing nothing.
- The Setup form on the Overview has room to type: each field has its name and what it's for over a full-width box, values Squad found are filled in and tagged, Address is shown, and Use what Squad found puts them back.
- Run app knows more kinds of project: FastAPI, Streamlit and Flask apps (through uv, Poetry or a .venv), Spring Boot, Gradle, .NET, Deno, Rack, Hugo, Jekyll, PHP, Procfiles, Makefile and justfile targets, and a site in `public/`, `docs/` or `dist/`. Python runs with `python3`, which every Mac has.

### Fixed

- Floating menus (Run it later, the project picker on Today, Settings drop-downs and the engines popover) close when you click anywhere outside them or press Esc, and the click still lands where you aimed it.
- "Tomorrow" said after midnight and before 5 AM means this morning at 9, not the morning after.
- A Run it later time picked before typing a /plan or /race stays picked for the next job instead of being dropped without a word.

## [2.0.0-alpha.11] - 2026-11-11

### Changed

- A screen a bot shows in a job's feed is now a small preview with its name and a line on it, and Open large and Design tab buttons, since a screen needs more room than the conversation has. Architecture and flow diagrams stay in the feed, as wide as the feed and as tall as their shape needs, and direction pictures are smaller so the choices fit side by side.
- The rail's project ring is a thin frame with a gap around the tile, the chat fades out above the box instead of running into it, and Ask, Do, Plan and Race are one switch with an icon for each.
- A job's log and history read as a timeline: each step sits on an icon that says how it went, joined by a line, with the latest in full ink.

### Fixed

- Pictures stay inside their cards, direction cards wrap onto a new row when there isn't room, and the title bar names the Settings page you're on.
- A long branch name or a merge-clash title wraps in a narrow job panel instead of running past its edge.
- A bot's face no longer flickers now and then when it has two jobs on screen at once.

## [2.0.0-alpha.10] - 2026-11-11

### Added

- A job that designs has a Design tab beside Changes. It shows the screens its bot keeps in `design/screens` as a board: move around and click a screen to leave a comment, then Send to the bot hands the open comments over as your next words. While a design job runs, its board also carries out the bot's design actions (changing text, styles and layers through Squad Code's design tools), so those work without opening anything first.
- Bots show pictures in a job's feed. A bot that makes a screenshot, a mockup or an architecture diagram shows it in the feed with a title and a line on what to notice, and clicking it opens it full size. Before designing new screens, a bot shows two to four directions side by side with its own pick marked; Use on one tells the bot to carry on in that look, and you can also say what to mix in the box. The pictures are kept in Squad Code's own folder, so they stay after the job's branch is gone.
- Files open inside Squad Code. Clicking a file in a message, a job's files or the Files tab shows it in a viewer over the page: code with its colours and line numbers, Markdown as a page (or its source), pictures, and PDFs on a Mac. An HTML page has Preview, which shows it in the job's own browser. Open with hands the file to another app, and Escape closes it.

### Changed

- Your server gets its work through git, never by copying files. A project goes there as a clone of your branch (no `.env`, nothing uncommitted, nothing git ignores), and each job gets its own branch, made here at the commit you're on and handed over through a hub repository on the server. The job starts from exactly that commit, even when the server's copy is on another branch, and if the hand-off fails it runs here instead of starting from old code. When you approve, its branch comes back without touching a branch of yours with the same name. Projects copied there before keep working: they get a hub the first time a job goes to them.
- A simpler window, with each thing shown once:
  - The sidebar keeps Needs you, All jobs and Crew. Usage opens from the spend in the status bar, the Try list is gone (its links are in Settings), and the sidebar's search and new-job buttons are gone too: the search box in the top bar and the thread's box do those.
  - A job's page shows its status once, in the header. The right sidebar's first section is now Summary (time, turns, cost and a line on where it's at), and it lists changed files only when the review card doesn't. A job that only reads no longer shows an empty Files changed.
  - Browser, Terminal and Open folder on a job's page are one **Open** menu, with the pull request when there is one.
  - Crew cards show the bot, its job, its status and its engine, with Setup, Chat and Give a job. Skills, tools and the jobs, success and spend figures are gone from the card, and so is the pin, which no longer did anything. Remove from crew is in the bot's Setup and its right-click menu.
  - A thread's bar shows its bots as faces only, without the written-out list of names.
  - All jobs drops its Needs you filter (Needs you has its own page), and each job's row shows the lines it changed and when, not five chips.
  - Settings takes the window beside the rail, with Back at the top, instead of sitting next to the sidebar. Mascot is a tab in Appearance, and How work runs no longer repeats the Engines list.

### Fixed

- Asking a job for more after its work was merged (a follow-up, or "Point at it" in its browser) made the changes straight in your checkout, which then stopped every later merge with "has uncommitted changes". That job now starts a fresh branch from where its base is, like a new job.
- Approve no longer stops because your checkout has uncommitted changes. Changes the merge would overwrite, and staged ones git won't make a merge commit over, are set aside for the merge and put back after (like `git merge --autostash`), and the job says so in one line. Only when your changes clash with what came in does the job ask, with a card naming the files: "Bring them back to sort out" puts them back with both sides marked in the file, and "Leave them in the stash" keeps them there. Nothing is lost either way.
- The Open menu on a job's page and Open with in the file viewer drop down below their buttons instead of opening over them (and over Stop).

## [2.0.0-alpha.9] - 2026-11-09

### Fixed

- The Mac builds of 2.0.0-alpha.8 failed to build, so that release has no Mac downloads. Smart Peek's llama-server is now built without OpenSSL, which it never needed, so both Mac builds go through.

## [2.0.0-alpha.8] - 2026-11-09

### Added

- Plans can be reordered and reassigned before they start: each step has Move up, and clicking a step's bot hands it to the next one.
- The welcome screen offers to install an engine it can't find, with the same command Engines uses.
- Alt+Up and Alt+Down move to the thread or bot above or below in the rail; with Shift they skip to the next one with something unread.
- Talk to a job while it works. What you type on a running job's page waits above its box ("Goes to Guard when this turn ends"), with a cross to take each line back, and reaches the bot as its next turn once this one ends and its checks are back.
- Needs you works from the keyboard: the arrows (or J and K) move through the list, Enter opens the job, A approves changes that can go, and E marks the rest seen. Changes ready to review get an Approve button beside Send back at the bottom.
- Long threads keep their history: a thread opens on its newest 30 messages and jobs, and Show earlier above them brings back the ones before, 30 at a time, without jumping away from where you are.
- Right-click menus across the app. A project's tile offers Open, New thread, Open terminal here, Copy path, Show in Finder, Remove from Squad Code and Delete folder from disk. A thread offers Open, Mark as read, Copy name, Rename, Archive and Delete. A bot offers Message, Rename or edit (Edit setup for the built-in crew), Show on the Crew page and Remove from crew. A job's row or card, and every message about one, offers Open, Stop or Run again, a terminal in its folder, Show in Finder, Open pull request and Copy branch name. Any message offers Copy text, Reply, Quote in reply and, for your own, Edit and send again. Arrow keys, Enter and Escape work in every menu.
- Remove a project from Squad Code, or delete its folder from disk. Removing only takes it off the list; the folder stays and adding it again brings its threads and jobs back. Deleting moves the whole folder to the Trash (never deletes for good), after a confirm that shows its full path, warns about uncommitted changes, and needs a tick before Move to Trash works. It refuses while a job runs there, and never touches your home folder, the top of the disk, or folders like Desktop and Documents.
- The night shift. Start a job later with `/later tonight`, `/later 2am`, `/later in 2h` or `/later tomorrow at 7am` (or `squad later`), and it waits in a Waiting list over the thread's box, with Start now and Cancel. A job for a bot that's busy waits there too and starts when the bot is free. When an engine says its plan ran out, the job picks up again on its own when the limit resets; on the night shift it switches to another engine instead of waiting.
- Rewind a job to any message. "Rewind to before this" over a message you sent puts the job's files back the way they were then and drops what came after, so you can say it differently (`squad rewind <id> [n]` too).
- Issues in, pull requests out. Name a GitHub issue ("issue 12", a link) or a Linear one (ENG-42, a link) and the job reads it first; its pull request says "Closes" it, so merging closes the issue. Review comments on a job's pull request go back to its bot, which answers them and pushes again. `squad issue` and `squad linear key` set it up.
- A project file. `squad.toml` at the top of a repository says how every job sets up (`setup`), which ignored files it copies (`copy`), how to run the app and on which port (`run`, `url`, `port`, so two jobs never fight over 3000) and which checks Checker runs. `squad project init` writes a starting one from what Squad finds.
- Point and change in the browser. "Point at it" in a job's browser lets you click any part of the page and say what to change; the bot gets the element, its selector and your words.
- Bots learn from send-backs. When you send work back, Squad asks whether there's a lasting rule in what you said, and the bot keeps it for that project ("Builder will remember this in checkout: …"). `squad lessons` lists them, and `squad lessons forget` drops one.
- Line comments in review. Click a line of a job's diff to leave a comment on it; "Send back with N comments" sends them all to the bot at once.
- Saving jobs costs less as history grows. Each job's feed is kept in its own file (`jobs/<id>.json`) and written only when it changed, so `v2.json` holds just the jobs, threads and chats. The window writes saves on its next tick, at most about once a second, instead of at each of the 90 places that asked, and writes what's left when Squad Code quits. Feeds saved inside `v2.json` by earlier builds still load and move out on the next save.
- A short sound when something needs you: a bot asking for your OK or asking you to choose, a job done or ready to review, or a job that failed, each with its own sound. Pick how they sound in Settings > General > Alerts: Bubble (the default), Marimba, Pluck or Glass; picking one plays it. Nothing plays for the job or thread you're looking at, and several at once sound once. Sounds can be turned off, or each kind on its own. The sounds are made by Squad Code, so they are the same on Mac, Windows and Linux.
- Peek reads each message with fewer tokens. Its warm Claude Code now gets Peek's rules once, as its system prompt in place of Claude Code's own coding prompt, instead of in every message. Each read sends only what changed: the crew, what's running, the new lines of the conversation and the message. Before, each of the 12 reads a warm engine takes repeated the full rules and the last 8 messages.

### Changed

- Plans read as plans: their cards say Discard, Edit plan and Start the job, a failed plan says Discard, and a job that is part of a plan says "Plan: part 2 of 4".
- A race no longer marks a try whose checks fail as fastest or cheapest, as long as another try passes.
- With more than six bots, the direct messages list folds the quiet ones under "N more bots".
- Appearance shows Solid and Frosted first; Engines shows your engines before Add an engine; the welcome screen points at #general.
- Try again is hidden while a job ships.
- The direct messages list says what a bot's jobs want from you: "asks you" only while a bot waits on your yes, "to review" when its changes wait for you, and "stopped" when its job stopped with a problem. Before, all three said "asks you". The Crew page uses the same words.
- Totals say what they count: All jobs gives the jobs kept and what was spent on them, Usage says its spend and jobs are for the last 30 days, and an engine's spend in Engines is for today, the same day the status bar counts.
- A job's time reads 4m 20s in its Details, not 260s.
- All jobs copies each job without its conversation when it draws, and a thread copies only the messages and jobs it shows, so both stay light as history grows.
- Delete folder from disk opens its confirm straight away and fills in the count of unsaved files when git has counted them, instead of freezing the window in a big repository.
- Your server's screen now opens only in Squad's own viewer, the same on macOS, Linux and Windows, with nothing else to install. The Mac-only Open in Screen Sharing button is gone. Keys follow your computer: on a Mac ⌘ acts as Ctrl and ⌘V pastes; elsewhere Ctrl is Ctrl, Ctrl+V puts this computer's clipboard on the server first, and the Windows key stays on your computer.
- Removing a bot you made always asks first, since it can't be brought back.
- Environment variables start with `SQUADCODE_` instead of `RUNO_` (for example `SQUADCODE_DEMO=1`), and `RUNO_HOME` is no longer read: use `SQUADCODE_HOME`.
- The app's folder is `native/squad-app` and its crate is `squadcode` (`cargo run -p squadcode`); the drawings crate is `squad-holo`.
- On Linux the launcher is `squadcode.desktop` and names the window class the app uses, so docks pair the window with its icon.
- The last places that still said "runo" now say Squad Code, and what an older build left behind keeps working:
  - A project's `.runo` folder (design pictures, and the record of what was added to agents' project files) becomes `.squadcode` the first time it's used.
  - New job worktrees go in `.squadcode-worktrees` beside the repository. Existing ones stay where they are.
  - Squad Code's MCP server is named `squadcode` for the bots.
  - Logs are named `squadcode-<time>.log`, and old `runo-` logs are pruned with the rest.
  - The default theme is `squadcode`. Settings that name `runo` still pick it.
  - Design screens are marked `squadcode:device`. Screens marked `runo:device` still read, and change to the new mark when their device changes.
  - The architecture guide and exported tokens say "Written by Squad Code". A guide an older build wrote still updates.
  - The agent registry reads `min_squadcode`, and still reads `min_runo`.

### Fixed

- Saved jobs, threads and chats are no longer lost when `v2.json` can't be read. A file cut off by a crash, or saved by a newer Squad Code, used to be replaced by an empty store on the next save. Now a job or feed line this build can't read is left out on its own, the file is copied or moved aside first, Squad Code says so once, and a copy from before each launch (`v2.json.prev`) is used when the file is cut off. Saves are flushed to disk before they replace the old file.

### Removed

- The classic Runo window (`RUNO_V1=1`) and everything only it used: sessions, projects, playbooks and their background job (taken off the computer the first time Squad Code starts), the phone bridge, the assistant, the arcade and the old settings, about 120,000 lines in all. The design canvas and architecture diagrams stay in the code for the bots' design tool. Squad Code still copies what Runo saved in `~/.runo` the first time it opens.
- The guide to the classic window and the old design notes.

## [2.0.0-alpha.7] - 2026-11-08

### Added

- Bots test web pages inside Squad. Each job gets its own headless browser (the Chromium-based browser already on the computer, or on your server for a job there), and its bot drives it with Squad's browser tools: open, look, click, type, press, back, screenshot and run JavaScript. Pages are read as a short numbered text outline, and each step reports only what changed plus the page's errors and failed requests, so trying a page takes a few hundred tokens instead of a screenshot each time. Click Browser on a job to watch that page live in Squad and click, scroll or type into it yourself; localhost links in a job's messages open there, with Open outside for your usual browser. Every engine gets it: Squad's MCP server now goes to every v2 bot whose engine takes MCP servers, and the others (like Grok) are given the same steps as `squad browser` commands. Builder and Checker are told to use it rather than an outside browser or Playwright.
- Connecting a server now checks whether it has a desktop for watching its screen. When it doesn't (or has one but lacks the screen tools), Your server and My server ask first: Install it puts in a light desktop and the tools and then opens the screen, Not now is remembered, and See its screen asks again instead of installing anything on its own. Where Squad can't install (no root or passwordless sudo), it shows the one command to run.
- Watch your server's screen inside Squad. "See its screen" on Your server, and "Watch its screen" on a job running there, give the server a light desktop the first time (Xfce on a virtual screen) and show it live in Squad, where your mouse and keyboard work on it (⌘ acts as Ctrl, and ⌘V pastes this computer's clipboard there). On a Mac it can also open in Screen Sharing. Jobs on the server open their windows there, so you can watch a bot drive a browser or the app it's testing. The screen is shared only on the server's own address, with a password, and reached through Squad's SSH tunnel.
- A Your server page, in the sidebar once a server is connected (and from My server's "See and control it"). It shows the server's processors, memory and disk every few seconds, how long it's been up, whether Squad is running there, the jobs running on it, its projects and its busiest processes. From there you can open a terminal on the server in the drawer (or one in a project's folder), stop a process (it asks again, and offers Force stop if it won't), restart Squad there, restart the server, and run a one-off command and see what it printed. It all goes over Squad's SSH connection, so nothing new is opened on the server.
- You choose where jobs run once a server is connected. A switch next to Send, and Where jobs run in My server, offer Squad picks, Always your server or Always this computer, and every job's feed says where it runs. With Always your server, a project the server doesn't have yet is copied there first.
- Your server and this computer stay in step through git, the way cloud coding tools do it. Before a job runs on the server, Squad sends it your latest commits. When you approve a job that ran there, its branch comes back here and merges like any job (or becomes a pull request), and the server drops its copy. It all goes over Squad's SSH connection, so the server needs no GitHub login.
- "Copy <project> there" in My server copies the open project to your server over SSH, with its git history. It no longer needs a git remote or a login to one; folders a project rebuilds (like node_modules and target) are left out.
- Git in the thread. Every job card shows the branch it works on, the commits it made there and how far its base moved since it started ("squad/apple-pay · 3 commits · 2 behind main").
- The seatbelt now runs before Shipper pushes a job and before a job is merged here. A secret, a key file or a leftover clash marker in the change holds it with a card that says what and where, with "Ask <bot> to take them out" or "Push anyway". Debugging leftovers are pointed out but don't hold it. It works the same for jobs on your server.
- Clash ahead: every 45 seconds Squad test-merges the work of jobs in the same project, uncommitted work included, without touching any folder. When two change the same lines, Peek says so on both jobs, with where, before either is approved.
- The Jobs panel has a Git side: the project's branch against GitHub (with Refresh), the branches the crew is working on with their commits, clashes and how far behind they are, and the watch-outs to sort out before approving.

### Changed

- One right sidebar on a job's page: Details, Jobs and Git share it instead of sitting side by side, and the top bar's Jobs toggle swaps it to the job list and back. The New job button is gone; jobs start from the thread's box.
- Sleeker thread chat. A run of messages from one person or bot shows the face and name once, times are clock times (12:41 PM), and a job that ended with nothing to look at is one clickable line with Try again.
- Clearer bot replies. A question gets an answer; a bot offers a job only when you want code changed, as a card with Start the job and Not now. `@Bot` in a thread is read by Peek, so small talk is answered in place and only real work becomes a job. While typing a DM, Start a job asks for work directly.
- The README describes the threads layout, with new screenshots.
- The menu bar panel is rebuilt for the Squad Code window. It used to say the window was closed even while it was open, and showed nothing else. Now it lists what needs you (a bot waiting on your yes, with Allow and Deny right there; changes ready for review; jobs that stopped with a problem), what the crew is working on, with Stop and a progress bar, and the last few jobs that ended. A box at the top hands the crew a new job without opening the window. With the window closed it reads your saved jobs, and any row opens the window on that job. The panel is as tall as what it shows, Quit asks first while jobs are running, Escape closes it, and the count beside the menu bar glyph now works too.

### Fixed

- Bots talking to each other: only the turn that just ended is passed on, so a stopped turn no longer repeats an old @mention; a bot's ask shows as the bot's own message, before the job it starts; a bot gets the whole message, not just its @line; and Guard can read the unmerged work it's asked to check.
- Signing a server in with your Claude plan no longer rejects the code from the browser. Claude read the long code and the Enter after it as one paste and dropped the Enter, so it never checked the code. Squad now sends the Enter on its own, reads Claude's screen the way a terminal shows it (Claude redraws only what changed, which could garble the token or leave a stray "B" as its last words), and if Claude turns a code down it shows Claude's reason.
- Connecting to a server no longer fails with "Host key verification failed" when your own `~/.ssh/known_hosts` has an old key for that address. Squad keeps its own list of trusted server keys, trusts a new server on first connect and shows its fingerprint, and if a known server's key changes it stops and offers "I rebuilt it: trust the new key and connect".
- Connecting to a server that makes you change its password on the first login (as many VPS providers do) no longer stops with "Password change required but no TTY available". Squad asks for a new password, changes it on the server and carries on.
- Locking down a server now works when you connect as a user whose sudo needs a password, such as `ubuntu`: the password you typed is passed to sudo over SSH, never on a command line.

## [2.0.0-alpha.6] - 2026-11-07

### Added

- `squad serve` runs the crew on a server with no window, behind one small API that every device shares (`/v1/...`, with live events). Devices pair with one-time codes from `squad pair`. `squad serve --install` keeps it running after logout and restarts, and `squad serve --set KEY` gives its agents a key.
- Settings has a new My server pane: connect your own Linux VPS with its address and password. Squad installs itself there, locks the server down (key-only SSH, a firewall that lets in only SSH, fail2ban, automatic security updates), pairs this computer and reaches the server through an SSH tunnel. Sign the server in with your Claude plan, or give it an Anthropic, OpenAI, Google or xAI key.
- Jobs that suit your server run there and keep going with this computer closed. They show live in the app, and Approve, Stop and follow-ups work on them as on any job. "Put <project> there" copies the open project to the server.
- Background images. Settings > Appearance has a new Background image card: pick one of six that ship with the app (Aurora, Dusk, Lagoon, Ember, Meadow and Blush) or choose a picture of your own (PNG, JPEG or WebP), and the window changes at once. Fit (Fill, Fit, Stretch or Centre), Blur, Dim and Show through adjust it, and the sliders preview as you drag. Your own pictures are copied into `~/.squadcode/backgrounds`, so moving the original doesn't lose it, and can be removed from their tile. Text stays readable: the page and sidebar never clear past the same floor that window transparency uses. While an image is set it covers the desktop, so See-through window waits until it's gone; see-through popovers work over it.

## [2.0.0-alpha.5] - 2026-11-05

### Added
- Squad's intelligence layer is now called Peek (it was Fin): Smart Peek in Engines, `peek` as the model name. Settings that say `fin` keep working, and a model downloaded as `fin.gguf` is moved over.
- Peek updates without an app release: Squad reads `latest.json` from the published model repo, checks each download's size and SHA-256 before swapping it in, and `squad brain update` or "Check for a newer model" in Settings moves to the newest one. `training/publish.sh` publishes a new version.
- Peek's tiny classifier, built into the app (370 KB, no download): it picks the kind of job before the keyword rules, and gets 117 of 120 messy test sentences right against the rules' 70. `squad brain eval hard` scores the new messy set.
- Smart Peek is now opt-in from Engines: turning it on downloads Squad's own model once (505 MB), and Squad starts its own llama-server only when the rules aren't sure of a job, stopping it after 5 idle minutes or when Squad quits. `squad brain install` and `squad brain remove` do the same from a terminal. The Mac app ships llama-server inside it.

- Squad's own intelligence layer (`v2/brain`): it routes a typed job to the right bot and kind of job, decides whether a job runs here or on your server (and says why in the job's feed), suggests a bot to make when the same kind of job keeps coming up, and writes Peek's lines. Rules do all of it with no download; Smart Peek (`brain_model` in settings) asks a small model on your own computer first, over llama-server's or Ollama's local API, and keeps its answer only if it checks out.
- `squad do <words>` lets Peek pick the bot. `squad brain why|ideas|export|eval` shows where a job would go, the bot Peek would suggest, writes your finished jobs as training examples, and scores routing on a fixed test set.
- `training/`: the fixed test set and the scripts to fine-tune Squad's own model from an open base model.

- Themes. Settings has a new Appearance pane with seven themes, each with a live preview: Midnight (the original look), Graphite, Deep sea and Daylight, which are solid, and three frosted glass themes, Frost, Mist and Aurora, which let your desktop show through the window, blurred. A theme applies the moment you pick it and is remembered.

### Fixed

- Bot avatars show the whole bot. Guard's cap, shield and baton (and every other hat and prop) were cut off at the edge of the square, most visibly in the job inspector.

## [2.0.0-alpha.4] - 2026-11-03

### Added

- Home has an inspector down the right: the picked job's bot, status, engine, folder, files and cost, and its plan step by step, with Open job and Stop. Click a row in the table to pick it; double-click to open it.
- A Usage page (in the sidebar, or ⌘7): spend, jobs, success rate and time at work over the last 30 days, a per-day chart split by bot, and a table for each bot.

### Changed

- Inbox is a two-pane view: what needs you on the left, and on the right what the bot said, the files it changed and its plan, with Mark as seen and Ask for changes.
- Jobs is a full table with each job's bot, status, progress, engine, time, cost, files and last update.
- Crew cards are compact: the bot, what it's doing, its jobs, success rate and spend, the engine it runs on, and Chat and Give a job.
- Engines has the same plain heading as every other page.

### Fixed

- Bubbles are no longer cut off at the edge of their square. Builder's ears and floating drop on Home, and the tops of Builder and Checker in the sidebar, were sliced off. Avatars now frame the whole bot. Floating drops, sparkles and badges stay inside the frame, Guard's shield gets a little more room, and avatars no longer draw a ground shadow.

## [2.0.0-alpha.3] - 2026-11-03

### Changed

- A new, enterprise-style layout. The dock and the icon rail are replaced by a sidebar: the folder you're in, search (⌘K), Home, Inbox, Jobs, Chats and Crew, then the crew itself, one row per bot with its bubble, what it's doing right now and a progress bar while it works.
- A top bar over every page shows where you are, how many jobs are running and a New job button.
- Home is a working page: a short header, the job box with the chosen bot's bubble beside it, a strip of numbers (running, needs you, done today, spend today) and a jobs table with Active, Needs you and Finished tabs, showing each job's bot, status, progress, files changed and last update.
- A calmer look throughout: a neutral grey page, white surfaces with thin borders instead of soft shadows and a colour wash, smaller headings, and tighter buttons and tabs. The bubbles are the one colourful element.
- Chat uses the whole width; you pick the bot in the sidebar. History is now called Jobs.

## [2.0.0-alpha.2] - 2026-11-03

### Changed

- The crew is back to the bubble bots; the crystal look from alpha.1 is gone.
- Bubbles are easier to see on the pale window: richer colour inside and a crisp outline in each bot's own colour, even at avatar size.
- The dock has its own strip at the bottom of the window instead of floating over the page, so it never covers a card, a reply or the chat box. Its bots are bigger (66 px at rest, 94 px under the pointer).
- Bots in job lists, chats and Live are bigger, and avatars are framed tighter around the bubble.

### Fixed

- Runo no longer reads the whole Claude Code program (about 300 MB) and every recent session log into memory at launch, which caused a 1 GB spike and much of the startup CPU. The model list is scanned in small pieces once per Claude Code update, and only the end of each log is read. Peak memory at launch is now under 50 MB.

## [2.0.0-alpha.1] - 2026-11-03

The first early build of Runo v2, published as a prerelease. The in-app updater on the 0.5 line never offers it.

### Added

- Runo v2's new window opens by default, with Today, Inbox, History, Crew, chats with each bot and live job views. Set `RUNO_V1=1` to open the classic window, which is also one click away on the rail.
- Quanta, the new crew: each bot is a lit 3D crystal with its own shape and a crystal prop. Builder is a cube with a hard hat, Checker a shard with a lens, Guard a gem with a shield, Fixer a pyramid with a wrench, Explainer an orb with a book and Keeper a diamond with a broom. Each has faces and motion for idle, thinking, working, done, needs you and asleep.

### Changed

- Bots animate at 60 frames a second, timed to the display's refresh. Frames are drawn on two or three background threads, and a window frame spends at most 5 ms on newly shown bots, so startup no longer stutters.
- Tags with a hyphen (like `v2.0.0-alpha.1`) are published as prereleases.

## [0.5.13] - 2026-10-27

### Added

- The post-turn CI watcher now works on any git host. Runo classifies a project's remote (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket Cloud/Server, Gitea, Azure DevOps, Unknown, None), scans for known CI configs (GitHub Actions, GitLab Pipelines, Bitbucket Pipelines, Circle, Jenkins, Buildkite, Azure, Drone, Woodpecker, Earthly, TeamCity) and shows a provider-aware chip — "Watching GitHub Actions", "No remote, no CI tracking", "Bitbucket Server not supported yet", "No CI detected on this push" or "CI tracking off". After a push the watcher gives CI about two minutes to appear instead of hanging forever, and refuses to watch on hosts it doesn't support yet. GitHub still works through `gh` as before; GitLab, Bitbucket Cloud/Server, Gitea and Azure DevOps are detected but not yet read.
- Each project has a `ci_tracking` setting (`auto` / `off` / `github_actions` / `gitlab_pipelines` / `bitbucket_pipelines` / `custom:URL`) that pins or disables detection for that project.

### Changed

- Crew's thread rules no longer tell threads to run `gh pr checks --watch` or `gh run watch`. They say "open a pull or merge request on your host, end your turn — Runo watches CI if the project has one, or moves on if not", so threads on non-GitHub hosts stop waiting on commands that would never return.

## [0.5.12] - 2026-10-27

### Added

- Antigravity now runs Google's Antigravity CLI (`agy`), signed in with a Google account on first run (browser OAuth, kept in the OS keyring) or with `GEMINI_API_KEY`. Headless streaming, session resume, permission modes and recap-on-fork work as with Grok and Claude Code.
- The post-merge watcher reads a turn's shell commands and reply text for what to watch — pushes to the default branch (including `HEAD:main`, `+main`, `-C dir` and env prefixes), `gh pr merge`, tag pushes and `gh release create`, or an explicit `runo-watch:` line — then watches that commit, tag or run and wakes the thread when every job finishes. The thread card says "Watching main CI" or "Watching release", and watching doesn't use a Crew slot.
- A turn that prints nothing for 10 minutes (3× that for known long commands like cargo, npm, xcodebuild and pytest, at least 30 minutes; blocking waits like `gh run watch` don't get the extra time) says so on the Working line, the thread card and to Crew ("#76 stalled 10m on gh run watch"), with Stop and Retry. A new Settings › Safety switch, off by default, can stop such a turn on its own.

### Changed

- Pressing Sign in on an Installed card (or on a failed turn) runs the CLI's own login command for providers that have one (Grok, Codex, Opencode, Cursor, Amp, Antigravity), streams its output into an alerts card and polls the local sign-in check every 2.5 seconds, flipping to "Signed in as …" without taking over the terminal panel. CLIs with a logout (codex, opencode, cursor, amp, grok) get a Sign out action on the signed-in card. Providers without `login` (Claude Code, Copilot, Qwen, Droid, Gemini) keep the terminal-panel fallback.

### Fixed

- Grok Build ending a turn with `error_during_execution` now shows a readable sentence — the mapped headline, the failing tool's text and Grok's own `errors` codes — instead of just the raw subtype. With a reason in the chat, the existing sign-in and model-switch fix cards reach cases they used to miss, including Grok auth failures that showed only `error_during_execution` before.
- A permission request whose card was dismissed no longer leaves a turn waiting unseen: pending approvals always show on the Working line with their answers, and a dismissed card comes back once the turn has waited as long as a stall.

## [0.5.11] - 2026-10-26

### Added

- The Runo assistant knows all of Runo. Each question now carries a reference read from the app itself: its version, every menu and Quick open command with its keys, every shortcut as you have it set, and every page of Settings with what each setting is set to now. Because it is built from the same tables the app draws, it can't fall behind a new feature or setting.
- The assistant can run any Quick open command for you, such as quitting Runo ("exit runo" now offers a Quit Runo card), opening the Terminal or going to Design. Quitting from the assistant quits for real even when Runo keeps running in the menu bar, with the usual warning if agents are running.
- The assistant can change any switch or choice in Settings by its name, or press a button there such as Check now for updates, each as a card you click first that shows the setting's value now and the new one. Settings that decide what agents may do (Safety, Connections, Phone, permissions, sandboxes) and anything holding a key or token stay for you to change in Settings, and pairing links and tokens are never sent to the assistant's agent.
- Guide articles for the parts that had none: quitting and updating Runo, Settings, Projects, Design (with its canvas keys), Architecture, the Timeline, Project notes, the Arcade, the Inbox and Home. Every place and command in Runo now points at an article, and the tests fail when a new one doesn't.
- Crew threads that push or merge to the default branch, or push a tag, are watched after their turn: Runo reads the GitHub Actions runs for that commit or tag, on the pull request watcher's pace, and wakes the thread when they finish ("Main CI passed for 1a2b3c4", "Release workflow failed: build (macos)"). The card says "Watching main CI" or "Watching release". A thread can also ask with a line such as `runo-watch: run 123`.
- A turn that prints nothing for 10 minutes (three times that while a build or test runs) says so on its Working line, its card and to Crew ("#76 stalled 10m on gh run watch"), with Stop and Retry. Settings › Safety can stop such a turn on its own after 30 minutes or more; it's off by default.

### Fixed

- A permission request whose card was dismissed no longer leaves a turn waiting unseen: it shows on the Working line with its answers, and its card comes back once the turn has waited as long as a stall.

## [0.5.10] - 2026-10-26

### Added

- Grok runs through xAI's official Grok Build CLI, which signs in with a SuperGrok or X Premium+ subscription (`grok login`) or `XAI_API_KEY`. It replaces the community grok-cli.
- Check for Updates… in the Runo menu and Check for updates in the palette. Both check GitHub right away and open Settings on the Updates row, where the result shows.
- Copy diagnostics in Settings, next to the logs: your version, system, agent CLIs, settings without secrets and the end of the log, to paste into a bug report.
- Helper agents show on the Working line ("Working · 2 helper agents"), the thread card and the peek; click the line to see each one's latest step.
- A per-project opt-in, Trust agent settings in this repository, for Cursor and Gemini MCP servers and hooks committed to the repo.

### Changed

- Runo's data folder `~/.runo` is private to you (0700, files 0600), existing installs are tightened on start, and saves go through a fresh private file instead of writing through links. Approval answers are signed, so only the Runo that asked can answer.
- Post-turn checks wait for you when the turn changed a file that defines what they run, such as `package.json` or a `Makefile`, so agent-written scripts don't run on their own.
- Approval cards and the Inbox show the whole command, and say what the one-line summaries leave out. Always allow saves a narrow rule (such as `Bash(npm test:*)`) for that project only, never a bare `Bash`, and isn't offered for chained or piped commands; an earlier allow-all-shell rule is flagged once.
- A pull request comment wakes a watched thread only when it comes from the repository's owner, members or collaborators, the PR's author or an installed app; other comments are quoted as information, never instructions.
- Calls from a VM or server over the relay can use only the tools that connection needs, and shared folders no longer follow symlinks.
- Prompts, SSH hosts and playbook links that start with `-` can no longer be read as command-line options.
- Update downloads are checked against the release's SHA256SUMS (and its signature, once a signing key is set) before Runo offers them.
- Threads' decisions reach Crew too, a thread can send several messages to Crew in a turn, and Crew's prompt puts a thread's words under their own heading.
- Crew's rules include guidance for fast threads.
- The context % uses the model's real context window instead of assuming 200k.
- Each launch's log is capped at about 30 MB.
- Going back to an older Runo keeps your sessions and settings: values it doesn't know load as defaults, and copies are kept before a version change.
- Releases list SHA-256 checksums for every file in SHA256SUMS. Apple signing secrets are scoped to the signing steps.
- Builds use a pinned Rust toolchain (1.99.0), CI lints the Windows build, and dependencies are checked with cargo-deny. Updated rustls, rustls-webpki and other crates for six security advisories.
- Internal refactors (browser locks, file editor and Browser tab state) with no change in behaviour, and new tests for the updater and cleanup.

### Fixed

- On Windows, features that read only `HOME` (playbook and Cove `~/` paths, save dialogs, and more) now use your profile folder. Step labels no longer show full `C:\` paths, and Keep the computer awake says it doesn't work on Windows yet.

## [0.5.9] - 2026-10-25

### Added

- Runo watches the pull requests Crew threads open and wakes a thread only when it has something to do: a failed check, a review or comment from someone else, or a conflict with the base branch. Threads no longer wait for CI inside their turn; when the checks pass, the thread's card turns green and Crew's chat gets a short note.

### Changed

- Post-turn checks come in two levels. Quick, the default, runs each language's fast check (such as `cargo check`, a typecheck or lint script, `go vet` or `ruff`) and leaves tests to CI; Full runs the tests too. Pick it in Settings > Safety, or per project in its Edit dialog. A check that couldn't run because the disk was full, a tool was missing or it was killed now shows "Couldn't run checks" with the reason instead of failing, and doesn't start a fix turn.
- Sending a message no longer freezes the window: the undo checkpoint, git, the post-turn checks and the end of a turn's saving run off the UI thread, and the checkpoint is cheaper. A turn that changed only docs skips its post-turn checks.
- Redraws cost less. A large diff lays out only the lines in view, the terminal draws in its own pane, and agents working in the background redraw only the sidebar, bars and rail rather than the whole window.
- The working indicator moves at a steady pace, without the hitches other redraws used to cause, and stays smooth however long Runo has been open.
- The assistant's corner mark counts only its own unread answers, and its input is a composer-style box that grows to six lines; Enter sends, Shift+Enter adds a line.
- The sidebar sets Crew's block apart from your own sessions with space and a quiet SESSIONS label instead of lines, and Crew's threads are indented under it rather than marked by a guide line.
- Runo does much less while you aren't using it. The Browser tab's frame timer runs only while a page is on screen, and agents' output and background results wake the app when they arrive instead of being checked 50 times a second. While the window is hidden, minimized or covered, git rescans, dev-server port scans, pull request and GitHub checks, plan usage and update checks pause until it is back; saves, queued turns, Crew, the menu bar and the Dock count keep going at a slower pace. Pull request lookups, and git scans of a session nobody is working in, come less and less often while nothing changes. Freeing build output and finding dev-server ports no longer scan every process on the Mac with `lsof`, and a quiet terminal no longer wakes the app 100 times a second.
- Post-turn checks and Crew threads scale with the computer. Settings > Safety > Limits > Checks running at once is Auto by default: one check set per 4 cores and per 6 GB of memory, from 1 to 6, instead of one at a time. Crew threads running at once is Auto too: one per 3 cores and per 4 GB, from 2 to 8. Each shows what Auto comes to, such as "Auto (4 at a time on this Mac: 16 cores, 64 GB)", and the fixed numbers and No limit are still there. Low priority for checks is its own switch, Run checks at low priority, on by default. The old background checks switch carries over: on becomes Auto, off becomes No limit at normal priority; a Crew cap left at the old default of 3 becomes Auto.

### Fixed

- The top bar and status bar stretch across the whole window again; since 0.5.8 their background stopped after their last item.
- A picture attached to a message no longer spills over the message's text and the rows below it. Thumbnails take their size from the picture before it loads, keep its shape within 220 × 160, and very tall or very wide pictures are cropped rather than shrunk to a sliver. Steps that read an attachment show its file name instead of the `.runo/attachments/…` path.

## [0.5.8] - 2026-10-25

### Fixed

- Runo builds for Windows again. 0.5.7 shipped without a Windows download because the frame-time stats used a Unix-only call; on Windows their CPU figure now reads 0%.

## [0.5.7] - 2026-10-25

### Added

- Image viewer. Click a picture in a chat, in the composer's attachments or in a thread in the Threads tab to open it large over the window, with pinch and ⌘ + scroll zoom, fit and 100%, ← and → through every picture in the conversation, and Copy image, Open in Preview, Show in Finder and Save as…. Esc or a click on the backdrop closes it.

### Changed

- The window is smooth when typing, scrolling, idle and with agents streaming. Only the chat rows in view are laid out, each message's Markdown is parsed once, the window's parts are drawn as cached views so typing doesn't redraw the rest of the window, and agents' JSON output and turn logs are handled off the main thread. The same goes for the thread open in the Threads tab. `RUNO_BENCH=1` plays the same scenes every time for frame times before and after.
- Crew's threads show only under Crew, grouped into Needs you, Working, Waiting and a folded "N done", in one-line rows with their status and time. The selected thread shows its agent, branch and worktree size, and a hover card has its details. The sessions you started yourself are listed under "Sessions".
- The status bar's plan usage is a small ring around each agent's mark, with the percentage only from 75%, a dot for a problem, and the full line in its tooltip. Clicking a mark opens the Usage popover with that agent highlighted.
- Crew's route bar lines up with the composer.
- The Arcade's games are tighter and more polished.

### Fixed

- A turn is no longer stopped with a false "isn't signed in" when the agent's own output mentions a browser sign-in. Only a plain line from the CLI counts as waiting for sign-in.

## [0.5.6] - 2026-10-25

### Added

- Finished threads free their build output. When a Crew thread is resolved, a session is archived or its branch is merged, the build and dependency folders git ignores in its worktree (target, node_modules, .venv, dist, build and the like) are deleted, while the worktree, its code and its branch stay. Worktrees in use are skipped and tried again later. Turn it off in Settings > Worktrees > Remove build output when a thread is done.
- Worktree sizes. A session's `worktree` chip shows its size, with Free build output in its menu, and a project's right-click menu has Worktrees and disk space, listing each worktree biggest first with a Free space button.

### Changed

- Each worktree of a Rust project builds into its own `target` again, as before 0.5.4: the shared build folder, its switch under Settings > Worktrees and the two-jobs limit for checks on 8 GB computers are gone. A settings file that still has the switch loads as before.
- Post-turn checks run in the background, one session at a time: at low CPU and disk priority, with what they start, and in order when several threads finish together, with "Waiting for another check…" and Cancel on the waiting ones. Turn it off in Settings > Safety > Limits > Run checks in the background, one at a time.
- The working indicator is a glowing ring with one label that says what the agent is doing, such as Reading, Editing or Running Bash, with a band of the accent passing along it. When a turn ends on its own, the ring closes, turns green and shows a check with "Worked" and the time. Moving parts of the main window redraw at most 60 times a second, and hold still while the window isn't active, with Animations off or with Reduce motion on, while elapsed times keep counting.

### Fixed

- A thread's message to Crew shows as a From-thread chip, with the thread's number and title as a link and its status, instead of a red "Ran playbook · deleted" card.

## [0.5.5] - 2026-10-25

### Fixed

- Runo no longer says an agent isn't signed in when it is. A turn whose errors read like a sign-in problem now asks the agent first (Claude Code's `claude auth status`, Codex's and Cursor's status). Still signed in, most often because another run was renewing the login token at that moment, the turn goes again once after a few seconds with a quiet note, and queued prompts carry on. Only a real sign-out, or a second failure, shows the sign-in card.
- A turn that ends without a reply says why where it can tell: the disk is full, the agent ran out of memory or was killed, or it timed out; otherwise "stopped without replying", with Retry.
- Words such as "unauthorized" or "401" from an MCP server, a plugin or a hook, or from an earlier turn, no longer count as the agent being signed out.

## [0.5.4] - 2026-10-25

### Added

- Thread numbers in Crew's chat open their thread. A `#34` that names one of the project's threads is a link, with the thread's title beside it and its status in a tooltip; click opens it in the peek pane and Cmd-click in the main view. Numbers in code, after "PR" or "issue", and ones that aren't threads stay as written. Turn the titles off in Settings > Behavior > Thread titles beside numbers.
- Worktrees of a Rust project share one build folder, the main checkout's `target`, for agent turns, checks and terminals, instead of a full `target` each. A `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` or `build.target-dir` you set is kept. On a computer with 8 GB of memory or less, checks in a Rust project build two jobs at a time. Turn sharing off in Settings > Worktrees > Share one Rust build folder across worktrees.
- A turn that hits Claude's usage limit pauses instead of being lost. Runo reads the limit Claude Code reports with every turn, so new Claude turns wait until the 5-hour or weekly window resets (Send anyway still sends one), and the failed turn offers Carry on at its reset time or Carry on now. Carrying on continues the same conversation from where it stopped, keeping what the turn and its subagents already did, where Retry would start the work over. A Crew thread the limit stops carries on by itself once the window resets, and Crew is told not to start it again.
- Crew threads running at once, under Settings > Safety > Limits, 3 by default. Threads Crew starts past it wait for a slot and start in order as others finish, with Start now to let one go ahead; threads you start or approve never wait for it. Crew sees how many run and wait, so it plans in order instead of starting more.
- Hold threads and playbooks past a share of the plan, under the same Limits: once Claude Code's 5-hour or weekly window is that full, Crew threads and playbook runs wait for it to reset, so what you start yourself still has room. Off by default.
- Crew can give a thread a model, an effort and a budget. Its rules suggest a smaller model for mechanical work such as renames, docs and copy, list the agent's models, and ask for briefs that name the files and findings already known. A thread past its budget waits for you, with Send anyway.
- Subagent model for Claude Code, under Settings > Agents > Claude Code: the model its subagents run on, such as sonnet or haiku, while the session keeps its own. Empty keeps today's behaviour.
- A Crew thread's card shows how many subagents it has running, and whether it is waiting for a slot or paused at the limit. Crew's Started card adds up what its threads have cost so far.
- A run's summary says how much of its prompt came from the cache, such as "94% from cache", so a run that kept re-sending its context stands out.

### Changed

- The Crew row in the sidebar has its own look: a soft wash of the accent colour, the mark in an accent chip that glows while Crew works, and its threads hanging off it on an accent line, with a hairline below the Crew block.
- Crew threads are told to do their work in the thread, keep subagents for independent lookups (at most two at a time, never one per item) and run the full test suite once at the end. Crew is told to split work by area rather than by item and to start the riskiest first.
- Claude Code's usage in the status bar follows each turn as it runs, rather than refreshing only every five minutes, and a window past its warning point is mentioned once.
- The Usage popover notes that Chat runs Claude Code in print mode, which can use more of the plan windows than the same work in a terminal, and points to the CLI view.

## [0.5.3] - 2026-10-25

### Added

- Runo's Dock icon shows a red count of what needs you: sessions and threads waiting on you or finished and not yet seen, permission requests, unread Crew replies, and review requests and failed checks on GitHub. The corner mark's badge shows the same count. Turn it off in Settings > Alerts > Show badge on Dock icon.

### Changed

- Runo's window opens and responds about a second sooner. It no longer waits for your login shell's profile to finish before showing the window; agents, terminals and git still start with that shell's PATH and variables. Set `RUNO_TRACE_STARTUP=1` to log how long each step of starting up takes.
- The Arcade is redesigned as a games corner: a glowing ring in the game's colour, cartridge tabs, a score strip that ticks up, and a scene of its own for each game. Rules, keys, scoring and best scores are unchanged.

### Fixed

- A thread's peek pane in Crew stays where it is while you scroll up during a run, with the same "New messages" pill as the chat, instead of snapping to the bottom on every update.

## [0.5.2] - 2026-10-24

### Added

- Stack, a fourth game in the Arcade: Tetris with all seven pieces, a next-piece preview and an outline of where the piece will land. Left and right move, Up (or X, and Z the other way) turns with a nudge off walls, Down drops a row and Space drops it all the way. Clearing lines scores more with each level, and every ten lines is a level that falls faster. Press 4 in the Arcade to pick it.

### Fixed

- The chat stays where it is while you scroll up during a run, instead of snapping to the bottom on every streamed line. It follows the bottom only while it's there; scrolling back down, sending or opening a chat brings it back. While scrolled up, a "New messages" pill over the bottom of the chat jumps to the newest. The Help assistant's answer follows only while its panel is at the bottom, too.

## [0.5.1] - 2026-10-23

### Added

- Check now under Settings > General > Updates looks for a newer Runo right away, even with automatic checks off, and says what it found.
- Spacing handles in Design, as in Figma. A selected auto layout shows its gaps and padding as pink bands on the canvas; drag one to set that space, with Shift for steps of 8. Each drag is one undo step.
- Tidy up in Design. With several floating layers picked, Tidy up (⌥⌘T) lines them up evenly in a row or a column, whichever way they spread more.
- A colour picker in Design. Click the swatch of a fill, text or stroke colour for a square of shades, a hue strip and an opacity strip, the colour's hex and RGB, the theme's colours, and the colours you used last. The eyedropper (the pipette in the picker, or I with a layer picked) takes a colour from anywhere on the screens, with a loupe showing the colour and its hex under the pointer.
- Mixed values in Design. With several layers selected, each field shows the value they share, or Mixed where they differ, instead of only the first layer's. Fill opens when any of them has one, and its swatch is split between the colours in play. Typing a value still sets it on all of them.
- Review an AI change screen by screen in Design. Each screen under "Changed" opens before and after over the canvas, as a slider that follows the pointer or side by side, with Put this screen back to drop that screen's part of the change and keep the rest. Comparing a screen with a version in History uses the slider too.
- Queue asks while AI works in Design. The bar keeps a line to type in while the agent is busy; Enter puts the ask in line with what was selected when you typed it, and the queue shows under the working row with a way to take each one out. When a change ends, it's kept (it stays in History) and the next ask starts on its own.
- Text in Design is edited where it is. Double-click a text layer (or press Enter) and the editor sits on the layer in its own size, weight and colours, over its own background, instead of a plain box. The screen takes the text as you type, a small layer's editor grows to fit, and the whole edit undoes with one Ctrl+Z. Escape keeps what you typed, like Enter.
- Import from Figma in Design. Paste a link to a frame or a page under Add a screen (or pick Import from Figma in the frame tool's menu), and its frames come in as screens. Auto layout becomes flex with its gap, padding and alignment, so it stays editable; everything else sits where it was in the frame. Fills, gradients, strokes, corners, shadows, blur, opacity and text styles come along, pictures are saved in the design's assets, and icons and other drawings come in as SVG. It reads Figma's REST API with a personal access token, set once in Settings > General > Design and kept on this computer.
- Draw to ask in Design. Pick the marker (M) and circle, underline or dot what you mean on any screen, then ask: "make this bigger", "a button here". The ask carries a picture of each marked screen with the marks on it and names the layers under each mark, so there's nothing to select first. Marks clear once asked; Clear and Done sit in the hint over the canvas.
- Design snaps raw values to the theme. Snap to tokens, in Checks, writes every colour, text size, corner and spacing that is all but a token as that token, on every screen, one undo step per screen, so it follows the theme and dark mode. After an AI change, what AI wrote that way is snapped on its own. Values close to no token stay as they are, for the checks to point out.
- Try options on a layer in Design. The shuffle button on the selected layer asks AI for three different takes on it, toward whatever is typed in the ask bar, and shows them side by side under the layer, each drawn on the screen as it would look. Click one to use it, as one undo step; Esc keeps the layer as it is.
- Quick AI edits in Design. Ask about one selected layer ("make it a dark pill", "tighten the spacing") and the agent answers with just that layer's new markup in one fast call, instead of starting a session. The change lands on the canvas as one edit you undo with one Ctrl+Z, while a pill over the layer shows it's working. Asks that need more than the layer go on to a session as before.
- Design's number fields can be dragged like Figma's: drag a field's label or icon (W, H, radius, opacity, gap, padding, font size, X, Y, rotation and the rest) left or right to change it a step a pixel, or ten with Shift. The screen follows as you drag, and the whole drag undoes in one step.
- Five more background patterns beside Dot matrix: Grid, Blueprint (a faint grid with every fourth line stronger), Crosses, Rings and Stitches. Pick one in Settings > Appearance > Background.
- Choose where the background pattern lies: on the content (the page and the terminal), on the side panels (the sidebar, Changes and Files), and on the frame (the top bar, the rail and the status bar). Each is a switch under Settings > Appearance > Background.

### Changed

- The background pattern lies on the content only by default, leaving the top bar, the rail and the status bar plain. Turn on "On the frame" for the earlier look.
- Design's canvas handles like a design tool. Every side and corner of the picked layer resizes it: Shift keeps its shape and Alt resizes it about its middle. Moving or resizing snaps to the sides and middles of the layers beside it, its container and the screen, with red lines for what it lines up with and, while moving, the gaps to its neighbours. Arrow keys move a floating layer 1px (10 with Shift), reorder one in a layout, or move a picked screen. A dragged layer carries its own pixels with it, lifted off the screen, leaving a washed-out gap where it was. Alt-drag leaves a copy, holding Space pans, Enter steps into a layer's children, Shift+Enter steps out, and Tab and Shift+Tab go to the next and previous layer.

### Fixed

- A fill made from a mixed token, such as `color-mix()`, shows its colour in the inspector instead of looking empty.
- The session header fits a narrow window or panel. Nothing is cut off at the right any more: as it narrows, Open Design, Playbooks and Runs on become icons, then Chat / CLI and the status do too, and last those actions, the branch and Delete fold into a More menu. The title keeps its room until the very end.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-10-23

### Fixed

- The SQL editor in Data's Query tab, and the file viewer, sit on the page's own surface: no more black gutter and current-line bar on glass, and the line numbers and current line take the theme's colours in light and dark.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-10-23

### Added

- A Data place for each project, beside Design and Architecture (⌘9). It finds the databases the project uses in its `.env` files, Docker Compose services, Prisma, Drizzle and Rails configs and SQLite files, and shows where each was found and whether it's running. Connect to a Postgres or SQLite database to browse its tables: filter by typing `status = failed`, sort by a column, follow keys to the rows they point at, and see the rows that point back. Every connection is read-only, enforced by the database itself. Columns that look personal or secret stay masked until you reveal them, and pasted passwords go to the Keychain, never to Runo's files. MySQL, Redis and MongoDB are found and listed now, and open in a later release.
- The Data place's Query tab: an SQL editor that completes tables and columns, runs read-only statements (Ctrl-Enter or ⌘-Enter) inside a transaction that's always rolled back, keeps saved queries per connection and recent runs, and exports a query or a filtered table as CSV with hidden columns left out. Count a table's rows exactly, and see each column's empty and distinct values and most common values, estimated or counted. On production connections, a read that would scan every row of a big table waits for Run anyway. A Diagram tab draws the tables and their foreign keys.
- Ask an agent about a table or a whole database from the Data place, with the schema attached. Agents started from Runo can list a project's databases, describe tables and run read-only queries through Runo's data tools, with hidden columns masked and heavy reads on production refused; what they ran shows on the connection's page.
- Tighter safety for the Data place:
  - **Queries:** reads that hide a write (a DELETE inside WITH, EXPLAIN ANALYZE of an UPDATE, SELECT INTO, FOR UPDATE) are refused, along with more functions that reach outside the database. Masking now follows a column through renames and expressions, so `email AS contact` stays hidden for you and for agents.
  - **Connecting:** remote Postgres never falls back to unencrypted, a connection's page shows whether it's encrypted and verified and warns about superuser roles, and production connections wait for Connect read-only. Statements give up waiting on locks after 3 seconds.
  - **Files:** only SQLite files inside the project are offered, and they're opened as untrusted files. Passwords are kept out of error messages, and saved connections, queries and secrets are written readable only by you.
- Talk to Claude Code while it works. A message sent during a turn goes straight to the agent, which reads it before its next step, instead of waiting in the queue; the reply carries on below it. A message that arrives after Claude has finished is queued for the next turn as before. Other agents still queue.
- OpenCode, Gemini CLI, Qwen Code, Copilot and Cursor run over the Agent Client Protocol when the installed CLI supports it: one live session per turn instead of a print-mode run. Their permission requests follow the session's mode, so Auto edit really means edits go ahead and commands ask, and anything the mode doesn't settle waits for you in the corner card and the Inbox. Plan only uses the agent's own plan mode. MCP servers go to the agent directly, so Runo no longer edits `.cursor/`, `.gemini/` or `.factory/` files for them. A CLI that can't open a session runs in print mode as before. Set `RUNO_NO_ACP=1` to keep every agent in print mode.
- Codex runs through its app server when the installed Codex has one. A message sent while Codex works steers the running turn, and Codex reads it before its next step. Commands that need more than the sandbox allows, and file changes outside the session folder, ask you in the corner card and the Inbox instead of failing. Reply text streams in as it's written, and the context meter follows each model call. A Codex without an app server, or one whose app server won't take the turn, runs `codex exec` as before. Set `RUNO_NO_APP_SERVER=1` to always use `exec`.
- Amp takes messages while it works too, when the installed Amp lists `--stream-json-input`: a message sent during a turn goes straight to it, as with Claude Code.
- Pi, the open-source agent from pi.dev, as a new agent. It runs over Pi's RPC mode, so a message sent while it works steers it after its current tool call, and the conversation is kept by Pi under the session's id. Pi's model list (any provider it has keys for) and thinking levels show in the composer. Pi asks nothing before it acts, so Runo's mode picks its tools: Plan only gets tools that read, Auto edit adds editing but no shell, Full access gets everything. A Pi without RPC mode runs `pi --mode json` instead. Set `RUNO_NO_RPC=1` to always use JSON mode.
- Agents are described as data. Each agent's command, install, sign-in, output format, protocols and the flags only newer releases have now come from a manifest built into Runo. An `agents.json` in Runo's folder (`~/.runo/agents.json`) can change any of those facts, or add an agent of your own: an entry with an id, a name, a command and its ACP arguments, such as `{"agents":[{"id":"kimi","name":"Kimi","bin":"kimi","acp":[{"args":["--acp"]}]}]}`, runs over ACP like the built-in ones.
- Agent fixes arrive without a Runo update. With "Check for Runo updates" on, Runo also downloads the agent manifest published with the `agent-registry` release, and keeps it only when its signature checks out against the key built into Runo and it is newer than the one Runo has. It's used from the next start. A fix for a renamed flag, a new protocol mode or a new agent reaches everyone the same day. The download is a few kilobytes, nothing waits on it, and it makes no model calls. Set `RUNO_NO_REGISTRY=1` to keep the built-in manifest.
- `Runo --check-agents` checks each installed agent CLI against the manifest without signing in or running a model. It shows the version, whether the help still lists each flag Runo relies on, and whether the agent's protocol (ACP, Codex's app server, Pi's RPC mode) still answers. `--report` saves the result as JSON, and `--since` lists what changed from an earlier report. A nightly workflow runs it on the newest release of every agent and opens an "Agent compatibility" issue when one regresses.
- The Arcade: three small games for the wait while agents work. Spark flies a lit spark through gates, Commits is a snake drawn as a git branch that grows on commits, and Merge is 2048 in the theme's colours. Open it from "Play while you wait" beside an agent's Working line or from the command palette. It shows how many agents are still working, says when they are done with a Back to work button, pauses the round when it closes, and keeps each game's best score.
- The menu bar glyph opens a panel instead of a menu, live as agents work. Allow, Always or Deny a waiting permission and Stop a working agent from it, click a session for its detail or to open it, and Ask Runo in the same chat as the assistant in the window, Run cards and all.
- Runo keeps running in the menu bar: with it on, ⌘Q and closing the window hide Runo and its Dock icon while agents keep working, and Quit Runo in the panel quits. Turn it off under Settings > General > Alerts.
- Dot matrix, a background for the window. A fine grid of dots lies on the frame round your work (the top bar, the rail, the gutters and the status bar), warming into your accent toward the top-left corner. With glass on it shows through the sidebars and panels too, like dotted glass. It follows the colour theme and accent. Turn it on in Settings > Appearance > Background.
- Shortcuts to show Changes (⇧⌘G), search in files (⇧⌘F) and open the Browser tab (⇧⌘U). On Windows, typing works in terminals again (ConPTY), and a shell's exit status is kept when it exits.

### Changed

- Codex now really runs through its app server, and OpenCode over ACP. Runo had been reading the wrong help text, so it never saw that either was available and kept both on print mode.
- Steps from Codex, Cursor, Gemini and Copilot now show as running until they finish, and a step whose tool failed is marked with a cross, as Claude's already were. Each step also records what kind of work it was and how long it took.
- Every turn is kept in a log beside its session (`sessions/<id>/events.jsonl`): the reply text, each tool call with the end of its output, token use and how the turn ended. A turn picked up again after Runo restarts isn't logged twice. `Runo --events <session id>` prints a session's log.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-10-22

### Added

- Runo in the macOS menu bar. A glyph by the clock counts the sessions that need you, or the agents working when nothing does, with a dot while something waits on you. Its menu lists what needs you and what's working, with each session's agent, project and running time; hover one for its branch, last reply, changes and cost, and to open it. Ask Runo… opens the assistant, and New session…, Open Runo and Quit are there too. Turn it off in Settings > General > Alerts.

### Changed

- A chat opened from the Chats menu on the Architecture or Design canvas now slides in from the right as a panel floating over the canvas, instead of leaving it. Read what the agent did, ask it more from the panel's composer, open it as a full chat, or close it to get back to the diagram. An ask from the canvas's AI bar while the panel is open shows up in it.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-10-22

### Added

- Proof of done: each project can list checks (tests, lint, typecheck, build), suggested from its manifests, that run after every turn that changes files. A card under the reply shows which passed and the end of the output of any that failed, with Run again and Fix it, which sends the failures to the agent. Failures can also go back on their own for up to 1, 2, 3 or 5 rounds, stopping when the same failure comes back. Second opinion asks an agent from another vendor to review the turn's diff read-only, and its comments land as diff notes ready for Send notes.
- Turn and token limits for every agent, under Settings > General > Limits beside the spending limits: turns per session, turns per day across every session, and tokens per day for agents that report tokens (all but Grok and agents whose output is plain text). Like the spending limits, a new turn waits once one is reached, saying why (such as "Held: 20 turns today (limit 20)."), with Send anyway. Turns and tokens per day are kept for a month and survive a restart, and all three are off until you set them. Codex, Gemini, Cursor and the other agents that report no cost now point to these limits instead of going uncapped.
- Merge PR uses a method the repository allows, picked beside the button (Merge, Squash or Rebase) and remembered per project; it starts on squash when allowed, then a merge commit, then rebase, instead of always making a merge commit. While checks run or the base branch requires them, Merge when checks pass turns on auto-merge, and the pull request shows auto-merge on.
- Architecture diagrams draw people and things as pictures: an Actor is a standing figure and Users a group of people, each with its name under it, and Browser, Phone, Desktop, Server, Folder and Security (a shield) look like what they are. A Person is a card with an avatar instead of a box with a circle on top, containers carry an accent stripe, components the UML tabs, and databases, queues and clouds their real outlines.
- More shapes on Architecture diagrams: hexagon, triangle, callout, block arrow, and a Flowchart section with start or end, process, decision, data and document. They export to draw.io and Mermaid.
- The shapes panel keeps its tinted icon tiles, with icons for the new people and things, and lines up more neatly: tiles fill the panel three across, list rows and section headings share one left edge, and the hint at the bottom wraps instead of being cut off.
- The Browser tab uses your default browser when it's built on Chromium, such as Brave, instead of always picking Chrome first. Arc, Vivaldi, Opera, Dia and Comet now work too, and Settings > General > Browser lets you pick one yourself.
- Delete screens on the Design canvas more easily. Right-click a screen to duplicate it, play from it or delete it, or select a screen and press Delete. A deleted screen can be brought back with Undo on the bar at the bottom.
- Controls work in Play on the Design canvas. Tapping a switch flips it, tabs and segmented buttons select, and elements with `data-toggle` or `data-show` change a class or show and hide a part of the screen, so a prototype feels real without any code. What Play does is never saved to the screen's file. Designs made before this get the new `prototype.js` unless it was edited by hand, and AI knows how to wire controls this way.
- Play moves between Design screens the way phones do. On iOS a screen pushes in from the side over the last one, which slips back and dims; on Android screens move along a shared axis and fade through; desktop screens fade. Back plays the move in reverse. Pick the platform at the top of Play, and give any link its own move (push, sheet, fade, shared axis or none) and speed under Prototype in the inspector. AI uses a sheet for screens that open as modals.
- Design from pictures on the Design canvas. The picture button on the ask bar adds mockups, screenshots or sketches, pasted or picked from files, and picks which ones go with the next ask. AI gets them attached and matches their layout and look using the theme. The design notes moved to Design rules under Theme, saved to `docs/design.md`, and every AI change on the canvas follows them. This replaces the separate References tab and its dev server preview.
- The shapes panel on Architecture diagrams shows shapes as a grid of tiles with their names under them, or as a list from the button beside the search. Sections fold away, a Recent section keeps the shapes you added lately, and a Logos section points to the logo search. The layout, folded sections and recent shapes are remembered.
- The Code map maps projects without a package manifest, such as a plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript site or a folder of scripts, from the files and what each one loads: pages' scripts, stylesheets and links, CSS imports, and JavaScript and Python imports. A small project is shown file by file and a bigger one by folder, and Insert diagram draws it with each file's name. Runo's own `design/` and `architecture/` folders are left out of the code, and a project with no code says so instead of listing manifests it didn't find.
- The agent picker on the Design and Architecture ask bars picks the model too, like the session composer: hover an agent to see its models, and the bar shows the one in use. An ask that carries on the canvas's chat switches that chat to the picked model.
- Re-link a Design screen by dragging the end of its arrow onto another screen. Link arrows now leave the side of the element facing the screen they go to and arrive at its near edge, spread out where several arrive, and links that don't touch the selected screen fade back. Each hotspot carries a blue dot with a ring that pings out of it, out of step with its neighbours, on the canvas and in Play. Play on the Design toolbar turns into Stop while the prototype plays, instead of a second Stop button.
- Asking again from the Design or Architecture canvas carries on that canvas's chat with the same agent, so it remembers the earlier asks, and nothing asks which agent to use. The first ask starts with the agent on the bar, without the New session dialog. Picking another agent on the bar hands it the chat with a brief of the work so far, and the bar starts on the agent the canvas used last. When the agent picks up its own conversation, an ask sends only what changed on the canvas, such as the selection or the list of screens, instead of the canvas's rules and layout every time, and nothing when nothing changed.
- Agents asked from the Design or Architecture canvas belong to that canvas. They stay out of the sidebar, tabs and Review, and opening one from All sessions or search goes to its canvas. A Chats button on the canvas lists them with their agent and state, to read a chat or ask it more, and the chat has an Open Design or Open Architecture button back. A canvas you're on counts as watching, so its agent finishing doesn't ask for you.
- Edit Design screens on the canvas like in Figma. Drag a picked element to move it: a line shows where it lands, beside the element under the pointer along the way its container lays out, so cards in a grid reorder. Drag its right or bottom edge or its corner to resize it, with the size shown as you go. Hovering outlines what a click would pick, and holding Alt measures the distances from the picked element to the one under the pointer. A picked row or column gets a bar to flip its direction, change its gap and cycle its alignment.
- Architecture diagrams you draw: a canvas with C4, flowchart and infrastructure shapes, connectors (straight, elbow or curved, labelled, with arrowheads), boundaries that carry what's inside them, snapping and alignment guides, a minimap, undo, copy and paste, align and arrange, lock, styles and a tidy layout. Every diagram is a view of one model, saved as TOML in `architecture/` in the repository and editable as text beside the canvas. Start one from the code, import a `.drawio` file, export PNG, SVG, `.drawio` or Mermaid, open a box's code, or ask an agent about a box. The package map stays as Code map.
- Architecture diagrams move: connectors flow, carry packets or pulse at a speed you pick, and shapes can glow, blink or spin. Select the connectors a request travels to make a story, then play it step by step with captions. Motion turns off for the whole diagram from the toolbar. Export an animated SVG, or a story player web page.
- Big architecture diagrams stay smooth: shapes off screen aren't drawn, detail drops when zoomed out, and connectors are rerouted only where something moved. Elbow connectors go round boxes in their way; drag a square on a connector to bend it, pin its ends to sides, or reset its path. Layers hide or lock shapes together, boundaries collapse to one box, ⌘F finds shapes by name, technology or #tag, and drilling into a linked diagram leaves breadcrumbs back. Bends, pinned sides and layers round-trip through draw.io.
- Ask AI to change an architecture diagram from the bar under the canvas, about the whole diagram or what's selected. The agent edits the diagram's files in place, guided by a README Runo keeps beside them, and its change shows on the canvas: new shapes in green, edited ones in amber, removed shapes and connectors as red ghosts, and where moved shapes were. Accept keeps it; Reject puts the files back exactly. If the agent's files don't read, the last good diagram stays with the reason and a way to restore.
- More AI help on architecture diagrams: right-click a part to explain it or expand it into a linked diagram of its parts, right-click the canvas to have AI add what the diagram leaves out, or import a picture of a diagram (a whiteboard photo or a screenshot) for AI to redraw. Checks list parts on their own, unlabelled connectors, parts without a technology and overlapping shapes; click one to go to it, or Fix with AI. New connectors between parts get a likely label, such as Reads and writes for a database, and new shapes land clear of others.
- Beautify for architecture diagrams, for the tangle that drawing by hand or with AI leaves behind. One click (or Shift+A) tries tidying in place and rearranging top to bottom and left to right, and keeps whichever has the fewest crossings, lines through shapes and overlaps, saying how many there were before and after. Tidy keeps your layout: it lines up shapes that almost line up, swaps neighbours to uncross connectors, spaces out overlaps and snaps to the grid. The rearranging layouts order each layer to cut crossings, leave a channel for connectors that skip layers and line shapes up with what they connect to. Connectors that share a side of a shape now meet it at separate points in the order they head off, and ones that would run along the same line are drawn side by side. Beautify with AI regroups parts by what they do, and Accept and beautify tidies an AI change as you take it. The checks list says when a diagram is hard to follow.
- Design checks, variants and describe-a-screen. The Checks tab finds what makes a screen hard to use: text below WCAG contrast, text under 12 px, targets too small to tap, images without alt text, colours set outside the theme, pages wider than the screen and links to screens that don't exist. Click a finding to pick it, or Fix with AI for one screen or all. Variants with AI makes three different takes on a screen, laid out under it; Use this variant swaps one in, and Undo puts them all back. Describe it to AI, in New screen, has AI design a screen from a sentence. The default muted text colour is darker, so the starting screens pass the contrast check.
- Logos and pictures on architecture diagrams. Type in the shapes search to find brand and technology logos from Simple Icons and Devicon (Docker, Node.js, Postgres, Kafka, Stripe and thousands more), downloaded the first time and kept for offline use. Drag one onto the canvas as an icon with its name under it, or onto a box to give it a badge; add your own PNG, JPG or SVG the same way. Pictures are copied into `architecture/icons/` so the diagram carries them, show in SVG, PNG and draw.io exports, and agents can add them too. Beautify now fits groups snugly and leaves folded groups folded.
- A design canvas on the Design page, like Stitch or Figma but on real HTML: every screen is a file in `design/screens/` drawn by Chromium, side by side on a canvas you pan and zoom. Start from Sign in, List, Detail, Settings, Dashboard or Empty state screens for phone, tablet or desktop. Click anything on a screen to change its text, colours from the theme, size, weight, padding, corners, width and layout, move it, duplicate it, hide it or insert blocks after it; Layers shows the tree to drag things around. Theme sets the primary colour, font, corner radius and density for every screen at once, with a dark preview. Drag a picked element's dot onto another screen to link them, then Play to click through. Ask AI from the bar under the canvas to design screens or change the picked one: the agent edits the files, the canvas shows the change live, and Keep or Undo puts it in or puts the files back exactly.
- Phone bridge: a token-protected API for a phone app (coming next) to see every session and what it needs, allow or deny permission requests, approve plans, answer questions, send follow-ups and stop runs. Turn it on in Settings → Phone or run `runo --phone`. Each paired phone has its own key and can be removed on its own. It listens on your Tailscale address, or only on this computer, unless you choose your local network.
- Connections: run sessions on this machine, in a Cove VM (local or on a server) or on any SSH server, and move a session between them from its header. Files, uncommitted changes and the agent's conversation are synced over the connection before and after every turn, and terminals open there.
- Turns on a Cove server or SSH server keep running when your computer sleeps, shuts down, loses the network or closes Runo. Runo follows the agent's output there, reconnects after drops, and picks the turn back up on its next start: the reply replays and the work and conversation come back.
- Settings → Connections with Test, VM size, network and idle stop for Cove, forwarded keys, optional GitHub access, and a list of this machine's Cove VMs.
- Agents can use connections themselves through Runo's MCP server (`list_connections`, `run_on`) and Cove's own tools.
- Playbooks as shareable `.playbook.md` files: install from a git repo, link, folder or the clipboard, export, update from the source, inputs asked before a run, and declared permissions.
- Native desktop client in pure Rust for macOS, with Windows and Linux also targeted.
- Projects and sessions with isolated git worktrees, live agent output, real git diffs, a file browser and a command terminal.
- Claude Code, Codex and OpenCode support. Models, permission and sandbox modes, effort and reasoning levels, speed tiers and agents are discovered from each installed CLI.
- Per-agent settings: default model, executable, extra arguments, environment variables and agent-specific options.
- Settings screen with search, light and dark themes, accent colors and colorblind-friendly diff colors.
- Desktop notifications when an agent finishes (macOS and Linux).
- Inbox lists agents waiting on a permission, plan or question, with Allow, Approve and answers inline; the bell, rail, Home and sidebar share one "Needs you" rule and the same status words.
- Quick open no longer opens the wrong item, and adds projects, Add project, split, close tab, settings pages and the open session's files from any mode.
- The layout comes back after a restart: mode, split, window size and place, right-panel tab, open projects and sidebar width; a panel you hid stays hidden.
- Tabs scroll, list in an overflow menu and drag into a new order. New shortcuts for close, next and previous tab, Inbox, split, message box, archive and the context menu (Shift+F10); arrow keys move through the sidebar, Home and Inbox.
- In a terminal, Ctrl+Shift shortcuts and Esc twice get you back to Runo. Esc no longer switches modes.
- Top bar: the project switcher handles empty projects, the Agents pill lists running agents to open or stop, spend shows today, the branch and breadcrumb are clickable, and Runs on shows the session's real connection and moves it.
- Home follows the top-bar project with an All projects toggle and Add project. The GitHub page follows it too and badges only review requests and failed checks. A project whose folder is gone offers Relink or Remove.
- App menu with Quit, and the window reopens from the Dock on macOS. Closing the last tab stays in Sessions, the tour starts in Sessions, existing users get a one-time What's new card, shortcut hints follow your keybindings, and blank session names are refused.
- Local agent turns keep running when Runo closes or crashes; Runo follows them again on its next start instead of marking them Interrupted.
- Limits in Settings → General: a card with Stop when an agent goes quiet for too long, spending limits per session and per day that hold new turns (with Send anyway), and a cap on agents running at once with a visible "Waiting for a slot".
- A log file per launch and crash reports in `~/.runo/logs`, with a card on the next start to view or report a crash.
- Runo checks GitHub for a newer release and offers to download it; nothing installs on its own. A release workflow builds signed and notarized macOS zips and disk images when the signing secrets are set.
- Each session is saved in its own file under `~/.runo/sessions`, only when it changed and off the UI thread. The old `state.json` is split on first start and kept as `state.json.v1-backup`.
- Chat context control: /compact (Claude Code's own, else a fresh conversation seeded with a summary) and /clear, also in the session's right-click menu. Fork a session from any turn, with the files as they were then, and edit and resend any sent message, which rewinds the files and conversation or sends it as a fork.
- The / menu lists the agent's own commands besides playbooks: its built-ins, custom commands (.claude/commands, ~/.codex/prompts, .gemini/commands and the equivalents of other CLIs) and Claude Code skills.
- Sessions page: search over titles, branches, projects and past conversations (matches show a snippet), filters for project, agent, status and archived, and sort by recent, created or name. Quick open lists archived sessions (marked) and sessions whose conversation mentions what you type.
- New session: pick the base branch (local or remote) and get a branch named after the task, such as `runo/fix-login-redirect`, numbered when taken.
- New project can clone a repository from a URL into a folder you choose, with git's progress and errors shown, then adds it.
- Architecture mode: a map of the project's packages, dependencies and module imports read from its manifests and code, architecture notes and decisions kept in `docs/architecture.md` with a generated Mermaid diagram, and agent sessions that start with both attached.
- The GitHub page refreshes every five minutes in the background, filters pull requests and issues by state, author and review request, loads past 30 with Load more, and lets you pick the agent for sessions started there.
- Review this PR: the agent writes its review to `.runo/review.json`, and Post review shows it for confirmation, then posts it to GitHub with its line comments.
- Playbook schedules can run at a time of day on chosen weekdays, or on a cron expression. Runs missed while Runo was closed catch up once on launch (Settings can turn this off).
- Scheduled playbooks can run while Runo is closed, from a background job: a launchd agent on macOS, a systemd user timer on Linux (`~/.config/systemd/user/runo-playbooks.timer`) and a Task Scheduler task on Windows ("Runo playbooks"). Each runs in a new worktree after the project's setup command, with the agent's settings and the playbook's permissions, and shows up as a session when Runo opens.
- When the background job for playbooks can't be set up, such as on Linux without a systemd user session, Settings → Chat says so under Run while Runo is closed, the log records why, and schedules keep running while Runo is open.
- Settings → Providers and each agent's page list every copy of its CLI on this computer (PATH, nvm, ~/.local/bin, Homebrew, npm, Bun, Cargo, Runo's own) with version and path. Pick the one Runo runs, Use newest when an older copy comes first, Update the one in use, or remove a stray link after a confirmation that names it.
- Each agent's page lists its models from the CLI's own list, Codex's hidden and retiring ones included with their dates, with Use as default and a Test that tries each model with a one-line prompt and marks it works, not available on your account, or needs a newer CLI. Codex can also save the default into ~/.codex/config.toml (off by default; only the model line changes, after a backup).
- A turn that fails because the agent is signed out, the model isn't available, or the CLI is too old for the model offers the fix under it: Sign in (runs the agent's login in the terminal panel and checks again), Retry with a model that works, Pick a model, Use the newer copy, Update or Install for Runo, and make the working model the default for the project or every session. Playbook runs get the same card.
- The composer's model menu marks models that need a newer CLI or are being retired, and a session on a retiring model offers a one-click switch to its replacement.
- A Review page lists every session whose agent stopped with changed files, with commit, push, pull request and merge in one place. A session's Changes panel shows where its work stands and a Review and ship button. The mode rail is regrouped to Home, Sessions, Review, GitHub, Playbooks and History, then Design and Architecture, with Notes and Settings at the bottom.
- The browser opens as its own tab, glass mode looks the same on every page, the GitHub page has clearer empty states and filters, and the GitHub and Review pages come back after a restart.
- Design and Architecture belong to the current project: they sit under its badge on the rail, their title switches project, and All projects shows a chooser instead of opening the first project. New project can start from Design an app or Architecture, making an empty git project in `~/Runo/<name>/`.
- Clean up in Settings > Worktrees finds what sessions left behind in every project: folders under `.runo-worktrees` that no session points at (archived ones included), worktrees git still lists whose folder is gone, and `runo/` branches no session uses, each with its size and a total. Merged branches and worktrees without changes start picked; branches with commits the default branch lacks are listed apart with a warning and never picked for you. Remove selected asks first, checks again that nothing uses them, and logs each removal.

### Changed

- Grok continues its own conversation from turn to turn (`grok -s <session>`) instead of starting fresh with the recent turns pasted into each prompt, and its session can be opened in the CLI view. Older Grok releases without `--session` still get the recent turns.
- The working row at the end of a chat has a new animation: a small comet circles a softly breathing dot while a glint of the accent colour sweeps across "Working", with the elapsed time beside it. It replaces the spinner and three dots, reads well in light and dark, and holds still when animations are off in Settings.
- Projects in the sidebar are easier to tell apart when several are open. Each project gets a bolder name with its icon on a tinted tile and a count badge, its sessions hang off a rail in the project's color, and a little space sets projects apart. Session rows take two lines instead of three: the title and time, then the agent and branch ("local folder" is no longer repeated on every row). The open session is tinted in its project's color, a folded project shows a dot when a session inside needs you or is running, and the pin and archive buttons on hover are lighter and easier to hit.
- The sample workspace shown before you add a project now gives each project its own color, so it previews the colored project rails in the sidebar. The README screenshots show the current app, with new ones for the Design and Architecture canvases.
- On macOS the Design canvas draws, picks and edits screens with WebKit, the engine built into the Mac and behind Safari, instead of a Chrome it starts in the background. It no longer needs Chrome, Edge, Brave or Chromium installed, screens draw as Safari shows them, and redrawing after an edit is quicker. Windows and Linux still use a Chromium-based browser.
- A new Ask AI bar on the Design and Architecture canvases: what it will change sits on it as a chip (the picked element, screen or shapes), with one-tap suggestions, the agent, and a round send button. While the agent works, the bar shows what it's likely doing and for how long, the canvas glows with the same line at the top, an empty canvas shows a sketch taking shape, and screens still being drawn shimmer. In Design, a picked element gets an Ask AI button, and AI changes only that element or adds what you ask for beside it. Links between screens are outlined on the canvas and in Play, with a toggle to hide them.
- The Ask AI bar on the Architecture and Design canvases shows which agent it hands the task to, with a menu to pick another installed agent and a line on how it works: the agent edits the files in your project folder and you review its change before keeping it. The shape or screen count and save status moved to a strip under the canvas, so the ask bar no longer covers it.
- While an agent draws or changes an architecture diagram, the canvas shows it working: a sketch of a diagram taking shape on an empty canvas, or a soft glow and a line saying what the agent is likely doing, with how long it has been at it. When its drawing lands somewhere off screen, the canvas fits and centres it. Importing a `.drawio` into an empty project drops the blank starter diagram, as Start from code already did.
- Deleting a session asks in a popup first, from the session header or its menu, instead of swapping the header buttons.
- Stop moved from the session header into the message box: the send button becomes Stop while the agent works.
- "Working" and how long the turn has run now show at the bottom of the chat instead of in the header.
- Split view is gone; it broke the session layout. Tabs remain for moving between sessions.
- The right panel (Changes, Files, terminal) resizes by dragging its left edge, and keeps its width after a restart.
- The Browser button in the session header only shows once something is served for the session: a dev server on a usual port (3000, 5173, 8080 and the like), or a local URL printed in its terminal.

### Fixed

- Small fixes from a walk-through of the app. A Bash step in the chat shows a pulsing dot while it runs and a check or a red cross when it ends, instead of a check from the start. A quick command's tab keeps its newest lines in view when the pass or fail bar appears, and the Output box follows new output unless you scroll up. The browser offer says "on this computer" instead of "in Applications" off macOS. The New project dialog takes a typed or pasted folder path (with `~`), checks it, and points to the field when no folder picker opens, as on Linux without a desktop portal. A session you stop reads Stopped in grey, with a plain "Stopped." note, instead of Failed in red.
- The terminal answers when a program asks where the cursor is or what terminal it is, the way other terminals do. Prompts such as gh's Y/n waited for that answer and took every key as part of it, Ctrl-C included, so the terminal looked frozen. Typing never blocks the window either, even when the program stops reading.
- The Design canvas no longer freezes the window for seconds while screens are being drawn. Undo, renaming a screen, changing its device, the theme or dark mode, and files changed by an agent used to wait for the drawing in progress, and on macOS that wait stalled until it timed out. Redraws also free the old screen images, so memory stops growing as you edit, and a canvas you're not looking at stops checking its folder.

- ⌘Z and ⇧⌘Z undo and redo on the Design canvas wherever you last clicked in it, and ⌘Z also takes back an AI change that isn't kept yet, like Undo on the ask bar.
- The Layers tab on the Design canvas shows the selected screen's layers however the screen was selected, instead of staying on "Reading the screen…". Layers show an icon for what each element is and its text or class, and the panel's tabs share the width so the Checks count fits.
- The agent and model menu on the canvas ask bars keeps its size while you hover agents with fewer models.
- Chats asked from the Design or Architecture canvas no longer show in All sessions, Isolated, Needs you or on Home, or in their counts. They live only under Chats on their canvas.
- The Design canvas no longer fails with "The browser that draws the screens didn't start" when a second project's Design page opens, or after Runo was force-quit or crashed and left its browser running. Each project's screens now draw in a browser with its own profile for every run, it gets more time to start, and profiles from earlier runs are cleaned up.
- Agents: permission modes now match what each CLI can do. Plan is read-only everywhere it is offered, Grok runs in full access only, and Amp, Copilot and Cursor respect Edit vs Full.
- Agents: Runo's memory server and shared MCP servers reach every CLI that takes servers by flag or env (Claude, Codex, OpenCode, Qwen, Copilot, Amp), and local servers are skipped for sandboxed or remote runs.
- Agents: Codex, Cursor, Droid, Gemini, Qwen, Copilot and OpenCode turns stream as structured JSON, with live steps, conversation ids, resume and token usage.
- Images: drafts and attachments belong to each session, queued prompts keep their images, files live in `.runo/attachments` in the worktree, and the attach button only shows for agents that read images.
- Queue: Send now and Retry, and the queue drains in order after a failure, a stop or a restart; a prompt sent during setup is queued.
- Turns: Stop ends the agent's whole process group, a first-turn stop keeps the conversation, and the split pane has a Stop button.
- Turns: a sign-in failure, even with exit code 0, shows how to sign in instead of an empty reply.
- Questions: an agent asking several questions gets an answer to each, and the alert stays after an error.
- CLI view: turns typed in the CLI are kept on quit, and the CLI no longer opens over a running chat turn.
- Handoff and history: recaps work for more agents without changing the conversation, past conversations load in the background without duplicates, and a resumed one shows its earlier turns.
- Landing work from the Changes panel: update a session from main (rebase or merge, with conflicts handed to the agent), merge into main, pull on the main branch, and clean up the worktree and branch afterwards. New worktrees start from the freshly fetched default branch.
- Per-file staging, "Commit N staged", and no commits while the agent is mid-turn. Commits, worktree creation, `.worktreeinclude` copies and refreshes run off the UI thread, and the Changes panel refreshes on focus and while idle.
- Create PR asks for title, body and base, saves the PR link, reuses an existing PR, never pushes the default branch, and logs only after it worked. Each session shows its PR's checks and reviews with Fix CI, Address review and Merge PR; Review this PR checks out the PR branch.
- GitHub page lists load and fail independently per project.
- Undo restores the agent's commits, file modes and symlinks, keeps your staging and your own edits, saves a snapshot so the turn can be redone, and tells the agent what was undone.
- Races: Keep this one stops the other racers, removes their worktrees and branches after confirming, then offers to merge or open a PR; racer counts include committed work and open that racer's diff against main.
- Deleting a session prunes its checkpoints and merged branch; branches like `a/b` and `a-b` no longer share a folder. Each project can have its own worktree setup command.
- Changes handles non-ASCII file names, shows "Binary file changed" and notes how many diff lines are hidden. Diff notes on removed lines say they refer to the old version and stay until the follow-up starts.
- Files tab is a folder tree with search in files, without the silent 2,000-file cap.
- The editor asks before dropping unsaved edits, keeps them across session switches, notices files changed on disk, opens non-UTF-8 files read-only and reports failed saves.
- Terminal: drag to select and copy, find in scrollback, Cmd/Ctrl-click links, mouse reporting for full-screen programs, italic text and a scrollback-length setting.
- Browser panel: Cmd/Ctrl-C copies the page selection, new tabs and popups open in place, console errors can be sent to the agent, downloads are saved, Linux browsers are found on PATH or via `CHROME_PATH`, and the dev-server list shows every listening local port.
- The login shell's whole environment (API keys and the like) now reaches agents when Runo is opened from the Dock or a launcher.
- Connections sign agents in: API keys forward even when set only in your login shell, Codex and Claude (Linux) login files are copied, and Test checks each agent's sign-in without booting a VM.
- Agent CLIs install on SSH and Cove servers for every agent (npm into a private Node, or the vendor's script, with sudo-aware apt) and follow the version you run locally.
- Sync problems after a remote turn show as a warning card with Restore kept changes.
- Moving a session hands the agent a brief when its conversation can't follow, and non-git folders can't be moved to remote connections.
- Detached Claude Code turns stop at the first refused command, so you can allow it and retry.
- Runo's own MCP tools reach sessions in Cove VMs and on servers through a relay, and shared MCP secrets stay out of remote command lines.
- Remote turns work on macOS hosts without setsid or GNU tail, and a turn that never starts ends instead of waiting forever.
- Backups to origin are off by default, never made for public repositories, leave out untracked files unless asked, and are deleted with the session; leftover copies, job folders and scratch VMs are cleaned up.
- Playbooks are held to their permissions on every turn and agent, with a warning where an agent can't be held, and agents ask before starting one.
- Scheduled playbooks run on the project's default connection with its setup command, never overlap, note missed runs, keep a set number of sessions and record a run history.
- Playbook updates show what changes and aren't pre-ticked when you edited your copy; input labels and defaults are editable, and `{{ key }}` works with spaces.
- Runo keeps its own list of MCP servers for every agent, and Settings can start a new skill.
- Agent installs can be cancelled, stop after 15 minutes, and offer to sign in when done.
- Claude Code asks for permission while its turn runs: Allow once, Always allow or Deny in the corner card or the Inbox, and the turn carries on. Requests from servers wait for a reconnecting Runo (Settings → Chat → Wait for permission answers).
- The CLI view works for sessions on a Cove VM or server, syncing the files and conversation there and back.
- The worktree setup command runs in a terminal tab, so its prompts can be answered; the agent starts when it exits.
- The Browser tab lists dev servers running where a remote session runs and forwards one to this machine to open it.
- Terminal: dim and strikethrough text are drawn (vt100 is now vendored with both attributes).
- Cursor, Gemini CLI and Droid get Runo's memory server and shared MCP servers through their project config file, merged with yours, kept out of git and removed after each turn. Grok has no project-level MCP config, so it still gets none.
- Settings → MCP adds and edits Runo's own servers in a form (name, command or URL, environment) instead of a JSON file.
- The CLI view and terminals pass middle and right clicks, drags and the wheel to programs that turn on mouse reporting, at the cell under the pointer; Shift keeps local selection.

- A repository with no commits no longer fails to start an isolated session: Runo's git init makes a first empty commit, and otherwise the session runs in the project folder with a note.
- Quit (Cmd+Q, the menu and Cmd+K) warns about running agents, the same as closing the window.
- Agents: OpenCode and Codex errors show their message instead of nothing or raw JSON, a turn that reports an error counts as failed, and expired OpenCode and signed-out Gemini sign-ins get the sign-in hint.
- Gemini: the session's mode applies in new worktrees (Runo marks the folder trusted), and follow-ups resume the conversation by its id.
- Codex: commands, edits and reasoning show while they run, and reply text streams when the CLI sends updates.
- Notifications are on by default, cover turns waiting for you, open the session when clicked, and work on Windows. Permission requests can wait indefinitely.
- Agents that can't resume (such as Grok) keep a one-line summary of earlier requests; Copilot sessions no longer pick up each other's conversation.
- Tests pass on macOS.
- Playbooks started in Runo wait for their worktree and run the project's own setup command there, instead of possibly running the setup in your home folder.
- Playbooks run while Runo is closed use the agent's settings, run the setup command first, edit in every agent's edit mode, and let Claude Code run commands when allowed.
- Codex: no Approval chip in Chat, where `codex exec` ignored it; warnings such as missing model metadata show once in the chat, and a model your account can't use points to the model chip.
- Sign-in is checked ahead of time: Settings → Providers and New session show signed-out agents, and a turn on one shows the sign-in hint before it starts.
- Spending limits, the spend shown and each session's context meter say that only Claude Code and OpenCode report a cost.
- Architecture reads Swift, Maven, Gradle, Ruby, .NET, PHP and Dart manifests.
- A CI workflow checks formatting, Clippy and the tests on macOS and Linux for every push and pull request.
- Agents: a model an outdated Codex rejects ("not supported when using Codex with a ChatGPT account", "requires a newer version of Codex") is reported as a version problem, not blamed on the account, when a newer Codex wrote its model list.

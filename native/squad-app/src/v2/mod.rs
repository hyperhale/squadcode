//! Squad Code v2: the crew app.
//!
//! A shell around Squad Code's bots: Today (hand the crew a job and see what is
//! moving), Live (watch one job as the bot works), Chat (ask a bot in plain
//! words), Crew, Inbox and History. Every job runs for real on the bot's
//! engine in a folder the person picked, and is kept between launches. The
//! bots are Fin from `squad-holo`, drawn as their moods change.
//!
//! Squad Code v1 stays one click away on the rail while v2 grows.
